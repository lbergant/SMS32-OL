# SMS32-OL

This repository contains web-ported assembler and simultor for SMS32 microprocessor.

## The program's purpose

x86 Microprocessor Simulator for students of low level programming.

sms32v50 is a Microprocessor Simulator based on the x86
architecture. It is intended for students learning low level
programming for the first time. This version was adapted for web use.

The simulator is based on the low eight bits of the 8086 chip.
It can be single stepped or continuously run. The CPU registers,
and RAM contents are made visible.

The simulator is programmed in 8086 like assembly code. This
is assembled into machine code that is NOT the same as 8086 code.

<!-- It is possible to control simulated traffic lights, seven
segment displays, a heater and thermostat, a stepper motor, a
lift and a snake in a maze. -->

CALL and RET are available. Serious programming
problems like multiplexing, procedures, parameter passing and
recursion can be tackled.

There is on-line help linked.
