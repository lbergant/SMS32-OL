; A program to read in a string of text and store it in RAM.
; The end of text will be labelled with ASCII code zero/null.
; --------------------------------------------------------------
; THE MAIN PROGRAM
	MOV BL,70	; [70] is the address where the text will
				; be stored. The procedure uses this.

	CALL 10 	; The procedure at [10] reads in text and
				; places it starting from the address
				; in BL.

			; BL should still contain [70] here.

	CALL 40	; This procedure does nothing until you
			; write it.  It should display the text.

	HALT	; DON'T USE END HERE BY MISTAKE.
; --------------------------------------------------------------
; A PROCEDURE TO READ IN THE TEXT
	ORG 10	; Code starts from address [10]

	PUSH AL	; Save AL onto the stack
	PUSH BL	; Save BL onto the stack
	PUSHF	; Save the CPU flags onto the stack

Rep:
	IN 00	; Input from port 00 (keyboard)
	CMP AL,A	; Was key press the "-" key?
	JZ Stop	; If yes then jump to Stop
	MOV [BL],AL	; Copy keypress to RAM at position [BL]
	INC BL	; BL points to the next location.
	JMP Rep	; Jump back to get the next character

Stop:
	MOV AL,0	; This is the NULL end marker
	MOV [BL],AL	; Copy NULL character to this position.

	POPF		; Restore flags from the stack
	POP BL	; Restore BL from the stack
	POP AL	; Restore AL from the stack

	RET 	; Return from the procedure.
; --------------------------------------------------------------
; A PROCEDURE TO DISPLAY TEXT ON THE SIMULATED SCREEN
	ORG 40	; Code starts from address [10]
			; **** YOU MUST FILL THIS GAP ****
			; Copy the data from prev address to new address
	MOV CL,C0
Print:
	MOV AL,[BL]
	CMP AL,0
	JZ Endprint
	MOV [CL], AL
	INC CL
	INC BL
	JMP Print
Endprint:
	RET		; At present this procedure does
			; nothing other than return.

; --------------------------------------------------------------
	END		; It is correct to use END at the end.

;TASK
;
;17)	Write a program using three procedures.  The first should
;		read text from the keyboard and store it in RAM.  The second 
;	should convert any upper case characters in the stored text 
;	to lower case.  The third should display the text on the 
;	VDU screen.
